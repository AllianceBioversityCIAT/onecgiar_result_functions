# PRMS Fetcher Service - v2.0.0

🚀 **PRMS Results Ingestion, Validation, and Processing Service**

This service validates, normalizes, processes and stores research results for the CGIAR PRMS (Performance and Results Management System).

## 🎯 What's New in v2.0

**Major architectural change:** Unified synchronous processing pipeline!

- ✅ **Eliminated EventBridge** - Direct synchronous processing
- ✅ **Unified Service** - Validation + External API + OpenSearch in one call
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Complete response with processing results
- ✅ **Simplified Architecture** - One service instead of two
- ✅ **Better Observability** - Detailed logs in response

**Before (v1.x):**
```
POST /ingest → Validate → EventBridge → 202 Accepted
                               ↓ (async)
                          Loader Lambda
```

**Now (v2.0):**
```
POST /ingest → Validate → Process → External API → OpenSearch → 200 OK
```

**HTTP surface (this service):**
```
GET  /result, GET /result/{code}  → OpenSearch
POST /ingest                      → validate, process, external API, OpenSearch
GET  /health, GET /openapi.json, GET /docs
```

Bulk sync, single-result PATCH update, and DELETE are **not** exposed here (use the separate sync/other services).
